PURPOSE
-----------
In this project,we are basically finding the most optimized route between a set of locations entered by the user for both Uber and Lyft


BASIC PARTS IMPLEMENTED
------------

1.UI
-------
This includes the User-interface part which initially asks the user to enter the number and address of the locations he/she wants to visit.
And based on the inputs the best route,weather details about the locations and map representation is displayed.


2.DATABASE
-----------
Once the user posts the locations,the database and tables get created and the location details get added to it which are then fetched by functions
using lyft and uber api's for finding the best route.


3.a UBER/LYFT
--------------
Implementation of this part includes functions which find the possible combinations of routes among the set of entered places and finally returns 
the most optimized route for the user based on cheapest costs.We also tried implementing many other algorithms like Djkstras algorithm,
travelling salesman problem,brute-force method etc



4.FLOW
-----
Step1:User enters the details of the number and address of the locations
Step2:The server is made up and running
Step3:Then the database and tables are being created using flask and sqlalchemy
Step4:When the user enters the locations,the details are getting stored in the Database
Step5:Lyft/Uber functions calculate the distance and duration between the locations of the possible routes using google Api and 
return the most optimized path for the user based on cheapest costs.
